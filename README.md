# Ressit

## Introduction

The web is littered with pitiful resumé templates. Furthermore, how does one know if his/her resumé meets all the current (and constantly changing) standards of a specific industry? Ressit is the answer. 

Ressit is a resumé rating platform that helps users find the best resumés for their applicable industries. A great resumé for a computer programmer differs vastly from a resumé that serves a waitress best. Users come to Ressit to get feedback on resumés, and to find the best templates available. Resumé producers upload for feedback, and resumé template seekers search for the best template available. 

Ressit can revolutionize and simplify the hell that is creating an amazing resumé.
